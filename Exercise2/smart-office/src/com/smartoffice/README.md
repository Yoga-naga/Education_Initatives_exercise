Smart Office App üè¢üí°‚ùÑÔ∏è

A console-based Smart Office simulation that demonstrates Command Pattern, Observer Pattern, and Singleton Pattern in Java.

The system allows configuring meeting rooms, booking/canceling, adding occupants, and automatically controlling lights & AC.

üìä Sample Run
Welcome to Smart Office App!
Commands (examples):
  config room count <n>
  config room maxcapacity <roomId> <capacity>
  book <roomId> <HH:MM> <minutes>
  cancel <roomId>
  add occupant <roomId> <count>
  status
  exit

> config room count 3
Office configured with 3 meeting rooms:
Room 1
Room 2
Room 3

> config room maxcapacity 1 10
Room 1 capacity set to 10 persons.

> book 1 09:00 60
Room 1 booked from 09:00 for 60 minutes.

> add occupant 1 8
Room 1 is now occupied by 8 persons. AC and lights turned on.

> status
Room 1 | occupants=8 | booking=Room 1 booked 09:00 for 60 min (ends 10:00)
Room 2 | occupants=0 | booking=None
Room 3 | occupants=0 | booking=None

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue

Currently, the end-time calculation may be off for some durations (e.g., book 3 07:00 240 shows incorrect end time).
This happens due to time parsing/formatting in the Booking class.

‚úÖ Features Highlight

Command Pattern ‚Üí Encapsulates user commands like book, cancel.

Observer Pattern ‚Üí Lights & AC auto-switch when occupants are added.

Singleton ‚Üí Centralized OfficeConfig ensures only one office instance.
